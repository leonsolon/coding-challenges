#PERSONAL NOTE: Took me about 2 hours. I had to review the theory of prime factorization and search the internet
# for methods to quickly find whether a number is prime or not.
# At the end, I simply implemented the prime factorization algorithm below.
# I have a feelling that there are more efficient ways to solve this problem. But, as I got 100% score and have other
# lessons to complete, I didn't bother to try to improve the code.

        # Finding the Number of Factors
        # We can find the number of factors of a given number using the following steps.

        # Step 1: Find its prime factorization, i.e. express it as the product of primes.
        # Step 3: Write the prime factorization in the exponent form.
        # Step 3: Add 1 to each of the exponents.
        # Step 4: Multiply all the resultant numbers. This product would give the number of factors of the given number.


""" A positive integer D is a factor of a positive integer N if there exists an integer M such that N = D * M.

For example, 6 is a factor of 24, because M = 4 satisfies the above condition (24 = 6 * 4).

Write a function:

def solution(N)

that, given a positive integer N, returns the number of its factors.

For example, given N = 24, the function should return 8, because 24 has 8 factors, namely 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. There are no other factors of 24.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [1..2,147,483,647]. """
